    <h1>Id versus Class</h1>
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <h3>January 18, 2016</h4>

        <span>First off What are id's and classes?</span> They are CSS like hooks that you nest inside elements to change only that specific element. For example what if you had a whole bunch of ordered list and you wanted to change the font-size on only one of them? The quick and easy way to do that would be to create a class or id in your CSS style sheet and hook it into your list like so: <code>ol class = "bigger"</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as when to use an ID over class. Well something about ID's that should be kept in mind is that an element can only have one ID. It can have many classes and even many classes and an ID but it can only have one ID. A good rule of thumb for using a class or an ID is if you think you'll use the ID more then once it should probably be a class.
      </p>
      <h4>Things I thought were pretty nifty learning about ID's and Classes</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>They don't have default settings. They are blank slates and an empty class or ID does nothing.</li>
          <li>If you include an id in the browser address like www.somthi.com/#gohere the browser will look for that id and scroll to it. This is if you wanted to load the page in a specific spot. </li>
          <LI>CSS does not care! Weather it is a id or class they mean the same. But Java Script does</LI>
        </ul>
