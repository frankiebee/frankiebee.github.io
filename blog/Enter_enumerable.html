          ***Disclamer***
          lets think about that word 'each' defined by <a href = "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/each">merriam-webster.com</a>
          Full Definition
          ": being one of two or more distinct individuals having a similar relation and often constituting an aggregate"
          Lets keep this in mind as we walk through the ways of #each

        </blockquote>
        <span>Sceen 1 #each:</span> Starting with #each: Each is a way to go over the element in a collection or range. Bellow is an example of what that can look like.
        <pre>
          <code>
  irb(main)> arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  irb(main)> r = (1..4)
  irb(main)> arr.each {|e| p e}
  1
  2
  3
  4
  => [1, 2, 3, 4]
  irb(main)> r.each {|e| p e}
  1
  2
  3
  4
  => 1..4

          </code>
        </pre>
        What we have done here is iterated over the elments in the array and range using .each and the code block <code>{|e| p e}</code> using the variable e and 'p' command to print to the terminal. #each returns the collection at the end. With out a code block .each returs a Enumerator.

      </p>
      <p>
        But lets also look what happens when we use .each on a hash.
        <pre>
          <code>
  irb(main)> h = {:firstname => "Frankie",:middlename => "De'Oror",
  :lastname => "Pangilinan"}

  irb(main)> h.each {|key, value| puts "#{value}"}
  Frankie
  De'Oro
  Pangilinan
  => {:firstname => "Frankie",:middlename => "De'Oror", :lastname => "Pangilinan"}
          </code>
        </pre>
        Going over what we just did we made a hash. Then we called .each on it, but notice how we had |key, value| where we declared the variables. Because its a hash in order to go through each element we need to have both the key representation and value representation in are code block even if you don't use one of them you still need to make its presence known.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now remember the disclaimer. The most important line in my option is "individuals having a similar relation" this is suggesting that the word its self references collections of a kind, but what kind? Like English definitions ruby can be loose but specific all at the same time. The general #each is used for collections and is more a base definition in the ruby language. But you cant use #each on a string because its not really a collection its an object. But it is a collection of characters. Well it turns out you can use an enumerable on characters with the .each_char {| variable | executable} example:
        <pre><code>
  irb(main)> str = "Hello world!"
  => "Hello world!"
  irb(main)> str.each_char {|letter| puts letter}
  H
  e
  l
  l
  o

  w
  o
  r
  l
  d
  !
  => "Hello world!"
        </code></pre>
        And there are tons of enumerable's waiting for you to use them but thats all for today folks
        See you again after intermission! :}
