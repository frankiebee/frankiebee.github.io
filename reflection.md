#CSS Reflection

For the most part it was pretty easy. I didn't really learn much just because i had already done the CSS exercises earlier in the week that actually had me learn all these things. I learned that CSS is okay but I'm not really a designer. I didn't have trouble on it for the most part but i probably spent to much time on it.
